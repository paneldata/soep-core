soep-core,soep-core-2016-hh-m34,Household (M3/M4) 2016,"The influx of refugees to Germany, which rose sharply in the second half of 2015, poses challenges for public policy, government administration, and the population at large. To effectively coordinate lodging and assistance for these refugees and to foster their long-term integration into the labor market, educational system, and other societal spheres, robust and reliable information is needed that can be generalized and applied usefully to the challenges at hand. It is up to the empirical social research to provide a data base for these purposes.  
\  

To meet this need, the Institute for Employment Research (IAB) of the Federal Employment Agency, Research Centre on Migration, Integration, and Asylum of the Federal Office of Migration and Refugees (BAMF-FZ), and the Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) at DIW Berlin are conducting a comprehensive standardized survey of refugees in Germany based on a qualitative preliminary study. Participation in the survey is voluntary, and the survey is being conducted by specially trained interviewers from the survey institute commissioned to do the fieldwork, TNS Sozialforschung in Munich. Conceptualized as a longitudinal study, the survey will be carried out in 2016, 2017, and 2018. In the first wave of the survey in 2016, the IAB-BAMF-SOEP Refugee Sample will cover nearly 2,000 adult refugees who arrived in Germany since 2013 seeking asylum.  
\  

**Questions about refugees’ living situations and the overall framework conditions**  
\  

The study looks at the living situations of refugees as well as their schooling, vocational training, and current occupational situations. It also collects information on refugees’ language use, living situations, family situations, social participation, and contact with both Germans and people of their own ethnic backgrounds. Other focal points of the study, which is conducted using standardized survey instruments, are the impacts of the legal and institutional frameworks for refugees and the effectiveness of various support programs.
