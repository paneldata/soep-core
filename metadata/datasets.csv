With the new IAB-SOEP Migration sample, migration history data was collected for the first time. This was done by means of a loop structure in the questionnaire. Two different loops were included: the one aimed at persons born abroad (i.e. migrants) and the one aimed at persons born in Germany. The dataset MIGSPELL was created in order to facilitate the use of this complex part of the questionnaire describing the migration biography of respondents.
